# REST API for appointment scheduler system
---
## INTRO
This project was created in order to gain practical experience.
The main idea of the project is to allow users to schedule meetings with clients.
There is also an opportunity for clients to make an appointment without registration.

There is an implementation of notifications and reminders about the appointment for clients.
At the moment it is implemented with the use of mail.
But I tried to make it flexible enough to be able to add different solutions.
